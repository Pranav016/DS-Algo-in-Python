In Heap Sort we use the Heap Order property.
In case we are using the Min Heap for Heap Sort then the Heap order property states that a node should be smaller than its children. We mainly check for its children not its grand children or further.

This operation is called Heapify for which I have made a function heapify.
Heapify can be done in 2 directions-
1) Heapify-Up
2) Heapify-Down

then we can take out the top elements/ min elements from this heap.
Then we replace it with the last element of the heap and call the heapify function again to get the min element at the top again.

Time complexity is O(n.logn)
Space Complexity is O(n) and can also be done in O(1)
