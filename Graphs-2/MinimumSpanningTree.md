# Minimum Spanning Tree:
For a weighted, undirected graph, a MST is a graph who's all vertices are connected without any cycles with the minimum total edge weight possible.
* There will be total n vertices and (n-1) edges in a minimum spanning tree.

## Kruskal's Algorithm:
Acc to Kruskal-
* Start selecting edges with the minimum weight.
* If the edge is forming a cycle then do not include it.
* We can stop when we get total n-1 edges.

## Detecting cycles-
* Detecting cycles is a huge part of kruskal's algorithm, one way to do it is to check if for any two vertices v1 and v2 already have a path between them. If they already have a path between them, then we will not include this new minimum weight edge.
* This approach takes approx O(n^2) complexity which is very large hence we have to come up with a better approach.

## Union Find Algorithm (UFA):
* In union find algorithm, different components of a graph are represented by a node from that graph only. This helps us to input and store the edges.
* When a new edge comes in between a source (src) and a destination vertex (dest), we check if they are represented by the same value / they are components of the same subgraph. Through this we come to know whether the edge will form a cycle or not.
* If the src and dest vertex are represented by same node value then the new inputted edge between them will form a cycle and if they are represented by different values then it will not form a cycle and we can keep the edge.

### Time complexity of UFA= o(v) where v is the no of vertices

# Prim's Algorithm:
* In Prim's , we have a starting vertex and we explore its neibhoring vertices and connect the edge having the minimum weight amongst its neighbors. We keep doing this untill we get n-1 edges and then our MST is formed.
