Graphs-
1. Adjascent vertices-  If two vertices are connected through the same edge then they are called adjascent vertices.

2. Degree of a vertex- The number of edges connected to that vertex is called the Degree of that vertex.

3. Path- The path needed to cover from one node to reach another if called Path.

4. Connected Graph- When there exist a path between any two vertices in a graph then it is called a Connected Graph.

5. Connected Component/ Island- Different connected graphs in one whole graph.

6. Tree- A graph which is always connected and does not have any cycle is called a tree.


Min Edges in a graph = 0

Min edges in a Connected graph having n vertices = n-1

Max edges in a connected graph having n vertices = (n)*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)....(1)
= (n*(n-1))/2
= O(n^2) which is the worst case complexity for any operation along the edge.
