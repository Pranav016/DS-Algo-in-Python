Heap is stored in an array which we visualize as a Complete Binary Tree(CBT). We use mathematical relations in the array to identify the Parent and the Child index.
Let i be the index of the Parent Node. Then,

1st Child Index or CI1 =2*i+1
2nd Child Index or CI2 =2*i+2

Parent Node= (CI1-1)//2
or 
(CI2-1)//2

Heap Order Property- 
Min Heap- 
Every Node is less than its children

Max Heap- 
Every Node is greater than its children


** For insertion and deletion we need to maintain the Heap Order property and Heapify or perform Heapification when heap order property is violated.
